# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the followint terms:
* object- an instance of a class
* class- the blueprint from which objects are created
* instance- a piece of data defined by variables
* method- a command that can be called to define a variable
* signature- a method's name and parameter types
* parameter- the data that a method uses to define variables
* type- data type specifies the size and type of values that can be stored in a method
* state- an object's state is defined by the attributes of the object and by the values these have
* source code- Instructions for a program written in a form that can be read by humans
* return value- the value that is output when calling a function
* compiler- a program that processes code into a form readable by computers

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html]()

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0 -int
* "hello" -string
* 101 -int
* -1 -int
* true -boolean
* "33" -string
* 3.1415 -double

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
Circle name = new Circle();
## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
void send(String param1);
## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
int average(int param1, int param2);
## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.
The book is an object of the class textbooks.
## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
An object can only be from one class.
