## Define the followint terms:
* object- an instance of a class
* class- the blueprint from which objects are created
* instance- a specific state of an object
* method- a collection of statements in a class used to manipulate (mutators) or access information (accessors) from an object
* signature- a method's name and parameter types
* parameter- an input of the method
* type- defines what values the parameter is allowed to be
* state- set of values describing an object
* source code- Collection of written commands that compiles to create an executable program
* return value- output of a method
* compiler- a program that processes code into a form readable by computers

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html]()

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0 -int, double, float
* "hello" -String
* 101 -int, double, float
* -1 -int, double, float
* true -boolean
* "33" -String
* 3.1415 -double, float

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
pirvate String name;
## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
void send(String param1);
## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
int average(int param1, int param2);
## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.
The book is an object of the class textbooks.
## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
An object can only be from one class.
